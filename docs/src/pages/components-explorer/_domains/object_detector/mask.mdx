Masks are used to exclude certain areas in the image from object detection.
If a detected object has its lower portion inside of the mask it will be discarded.

The `coordinates` form a polygon around the masked area.<br></br>
To easily generate `coordinates` you can use a tool like [image-map.net](https://www.image-map.net/).<br></br>
Just upload an image from your camera and start drawing your zone.<br></br>
Then click **Show me the code!** and adapt it to the config format.<br></br>
Coordinates `coords="522,11,729,275,333,603,171,97"` should be turned into this:

```yaml
coordinates:
  - x: 522
    y: 11
  - x: 729
    y: 275
  - x: 333
    y: 603
  - x: 171
    y: 97
```
