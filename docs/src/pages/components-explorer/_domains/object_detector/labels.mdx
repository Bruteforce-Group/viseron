Labels are used to tell Viseron what objects to look for and keep recordings of.
The available labels depends on what detection model you are using.

:::tip

To see the default available labels you can inspect the <code>label_path</code> file.

<div>
  <CodeBlock language="bash">
    docker exec -it viseron cat {props.label_path}
  </CodeBlock>
</div>

:::

The max/min width/height is used to filter out any unreasonably large/small objects to reduce false positives.<br></br>
Objects can also be filtered out with the use of an optional [mask](#mask).
