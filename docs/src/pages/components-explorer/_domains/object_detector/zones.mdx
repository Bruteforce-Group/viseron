Zones are used to define areas in the cameras field of view where you want to
look for certain objects (labels).<br />
Say you have a camera facing the sidewalk and have <code>labels</code> setup to
record the label <code>person</code>.<br />
This would cause Viseron to start recording people who are walking past the
camera on the sidewalk. Not ideal.<br />
To remedy this you define a zone which covers <b>only</b> the area that you are
actually interested in, excluding the sidewalk.
