The GStreamer integration reads frames from your cameras for processing by Viseron.

Viseron uses the `gst-launch-1.0` command to interface with GStreamer.

Hardware acceleration is available and automatically used for the `NVIDIA Jetson Nano`.

:::note

As of now the `gstreamer` integration uses FFmpeg to create recordings when an object is detected and FFprobe to read stream information.
Therefore, if you make changes to the `recorder` config you should keep in mind that it is in FFmpeg syntax.

### GStreamer pipeline

Viseron will try to generate a suitable decoder pipeline.

As of now only the `Jetson Nano` has a special pipeline which utilizes hardware acceleration.

If you have experience working with GStreamer, please suggest other pipelines in a PR or an issue!

### GStreamer audio pipeline

If your camera has audio, an audio pipeline will be automatically added to the GStreamer command.

The pipeline is rather crude and always re-encodes the audio to `aac`.
This is not optimal, but it works. Hopefully this will be improved in the future.

The default audio pipeline looks like this in YAML format:

```yaml
audio_pipeline:
  - "input_stream."
  - "!"
  - "queue"
  - "!"
  - "decodebin"
  - "!"
  - "audioconvert"
  - "!"
  - "queue"
  - "!"
  - "voaacenc"
  - "!"
  - "mux.audio_0"
```

### FFprobe Stream Information

Viseron needs to know the width, height, FPS and audio/video codecs of your stream.<br />
FFprobe is used on initialization to figure all this information out.

Some cameras dont play nice with this and fail to report some information.<br />
To circumvent this you can manually specify all these options.

If you specify all of `width`, `height`, `fps`, `codec` and `audio_codec`, Viseron will not need to call FFprobe and startup will be significantly faster.

### Recoverable Errors

GStreamer occasionally prints error messages which are of no real significance.

To suppress an error you can add a subset of that error to the `gstreamer_recoverable_errors` config option.

```yaml
gstreamer_recoverable_errors:
  - error while decoding MB
```
