## Setup your local environment

Some setup is required in order to do efficient development.

- Install the dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt -r requirements_test.txt`.
  It might be wise to do this in a `virtualenv` but this is up to you.
- Install `docker`
- Install `docker-compose`
- Install `tox`

## Style guidelines

All code is linted with quite strict [PEP 8 (Style Guide for Python Code)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP 257 (Docstring Conventions)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) coding conventions.

To accommodate this a few tools are used.

- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) to enforce the PEP's above
- [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to enforce the PEP's above
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is used for code formatting
- [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for sorted imports
- [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) to catch common misspellings
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) for testing

I suggest that you setup your IDE to match these requirements which makes development faster and easier.

## Development guidelines

The development process with `tox` is quite new for me so if you run into any issues, please let me know and we can work it out.

- Fork the Viseron repo
- Write your code
- Create tests for your new code
- Run `tox` to test and lint your code (**make sure all checks pass or your PR will be rejected**)
- Create a PR towards the `dev` branch

### Using tox

`tox` is the main tool used for linting and testing your code.
Simply running the command `tox` will run all checks. You can single out a specific check by supplying the `-e` flag.
For example:

- Run pylint only: `tox -e pylint`
- Run pytest only: `tox -e pytest`

#### A note on pytest

Viseron requires a lot of dependencies.
To make testing with `pytest` as easy as possible, `tox` will build and run a Docker container which executes `pytest`.
If you would like to run tests outside of `tox` you can build and run this container manually:

```bash
docker-compose --file azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env-file azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-viseron-tests
docker-compose --file azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env-file azure-pipelines/.env run --rm amd64-viseron-tests
```

### Develop Docker containers

Viseron heavily uses multistage Docker builds, and compilation of different components are split into different Dockerfiles.
To build all the `amd64` image from scratch the following commands can be used.

```bash
docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-ffmpeg && \
docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-opencv && \
docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-dlib && \
docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-wheels && \
docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-base && \
docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-viseron
```

Lets say you want to update to a newer version of OpenCV.
To do this you would:

- Edit `OPENCV_VERSION` in ./azure-pipelines/.env
- Build the OpenCV image: `docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-opencv`
- Build Viseron image: `docker-compose --file ./azure-pipelines/docker-compose-build.yaml --env ./azure-pipelines/.env build amd64-viseron`

#### Cross-building

To support different CPU architectures i use [Balenas base images](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/base-images/base-images/) that runs QEMU.
To build these you need to first register QEMU on your builder.

The easiest way to do that is to run:

```bash
docker run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```

You can then simply build the containers like you normally would and QEMU will be invoked automatically.
